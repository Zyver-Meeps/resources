*******************************************************************************

1) What is Sushi, huh??
   ====================

Sushi, huh? was created for personal necessity, is a program that's allow the
download of packages (RPM, DEB, etc.) for GNU/Linux, from a computer different
to the own, or also from a operative system that runs with our GNU/Linux
installed in the same computer.
Sushi, huh? was tanked for people that, for any reason, haven't connection to
Internet from their GNU/Linux, for example, because haven't the MODEM drivers
or simply because they can pay a monthly connexion. Because, install programs
for GNU/Linux is a hard process, if you haven't connection to Internet,
Sushi, huh? simplifies this process, allowing us to download the necessary
packages from any cyber coffee or a friend house.

2) How to install?
   ===============

Sushi, huh? wasn't thanked for be installed, Sushi, huh? was thanked like as a
mobile software, it means that you download from Internet, uncompress the file,
save it in a pendrive and use anywhere, you don't loose your time in
unnecessary installations and configurations.
Also you must have root permitions for install programs under Unix/Linux.

3) I know another methods/software that resolves the dependencies problem. Why
   ===========================================================================
   Sushi, huh? is better?
   ======================

Also I know this methods and software, but as user without a internet conexion
I have a bad opinion about this solutions.
For example, in case of the methods. This methods requires that the user:

1) Copy or create an script thats maybe he doesn't understand how to use this
script.

2) The user must download and configure manually the repositories
configurations files. Too hard process.

3) The user must prepare the files that will download before to go a cyber cofee and
cann't be modified later.

4) The user must use an specific webbrowser and install an specific plugin.

Sushi, huh? is aimed to people that is totally newie in the amazing GNU/Linux world.
Is aimed to people that do not have knowledges of shell, script, programming and doesn't
have time to lose. Sushi, huh? is totally user friendly.
Sushi, huh? do the hard process totally automatiocally and easy for you.
You can modify the number of packages to download in any time.
Sushi, huh? is aimed for the highest portability posible and you aren't tied to an
specific software.

In case of the softwares:

1) Aren't totally designed to resolve the problem.

2) Uses a GUI that isn't totally portable. Not all GNU/Linux distros comes
with WX, QT, GTK or TKinter preinstalled from base, and not all work with wine
(for developers).

3) You are forced to run first the software only on the supported distro and
cann't test it before choose.

For example some package managin tools, have some features that allow the users
to install packages from hard drive, but is not totally designed to resolve the
problem.
Sushi, huh? only uses the Python standard modules, but Python doesn't come with
an standard GUI module. Therefore Sushi, huh? uses the standard networking
modules and the predefined webbrowser to render a friendly nice GUI, achieving
the highest portability posible.
You are not forced to use an specific GNU/Linux distribution to test or
use it.
Sushi, huh? get you the freedom of compare and choice.

4) Sushi, huh? doesn't work in all web browsers and GNU/Linux distributions, what
   ==============================================================================
   happening?
   ==========

Is true, because the web browsers manipulates the information in different
ways. And not all GNU/Linux distributions provides support for uncompress LZMA
files or even a Python machine.
I can't test Sushi, huh? in all web browsers. I only test it in the lastest
web browsers.
Also I can't test it in all distros, I will only test it in the big fives
(Mandriva, Ubuntu, openSuse, Debian and Fedora).
I will don't maintain several codes for each operative system, and web
browsers.
I'm finding some solutions to this problem.

5) Why Sushi, huh? doesn't download some packages?
   ===============================================

Some repositories may cause problems because they are not fully tested.
Also, it can happen that some repositories are outdated, delete the line
[repository_dumped] to reload the repositories again.

6) Sushi, huh? really dowload all packages that I need?
   ====================================================

Not always, some time download trash packages.
The algoritm that resolves the dependecies aren't tottally optimized.
With the sinchronization support the trash packages are minimal.

7) Sushi, huh? say that must download 2Gb of packages, is too much, what I can
   ===========================================================================
   do?
   ===

Don't worry you can stop the downloads in any time and continue later.
Under Windows, close the Python console.
Under GNU/Linux, press CTRL + C, in the console.
Also, remember to synchronize Sushi, huh? with their distribution to avoid these
problems.

8) Why call it Sushi, huh?
   =======================

Sushi comes from:

RPM off line => ROL => roll => Sushi roll => Sushi

What?! => Huh? is the natural reaction when you see the OSbunshin file, and
well I think very funny join this reaction to the name, becoming in Sushi, huh?
like as the name official.

9) Why publish Sushi, huh? under GPL 3?
   ====================================

Sushi, huh? is not a fork of other software, it not use external software,
except for version 0.1.x and 0.2.0 that uses wget, but in the future it will
be removed.
Sushi, huh? is completly coded from scratch.
Therefore, I can license it under any license that I want, also I prefer to are
in the top of the technologies advances, and GPL 3 is the new one, and is the
license for free software by excellence.

10) When will release the next version of Sushi, huh??
    ==================================================

I don't know. I'm haven't a fix development time, when I consider that is the
time, I release a new version. But I try to don't delay too much the relese
times.
Now Sushi, huh? advice you when a new version is available.

11) Why your english sucks?
    ========================

Well, the english is not my natal language.
I can read and understand a text written in english, but I can't write
correctly in english because the range of words and sentences that I can use is
very limited. :P sorry.
I will study more english when Sushi, huh? reach the stable state, comming
soon.
