The Sushi, what???
==================

Sushi, huh? was created for personal necessity, is a program that's allow the
download of packages (RPM, DEB, etc.) for GNU/Linux, from a computer different
to the own, or also from a operative system that runs with our GNU/Linux
installed in the same computer.
Sushi, huh? was tanked for people that, for any reason, haven't connection to
Internet from their GNU/Linux, for example, because haven't the MODEM drivers
or simply because they can pay a monthly connexion. Because, install programs
for GNU/Linux is a hard process, if you haven't connection to Internet,
Sushi, huh? simplifies this process, allowing us to download the necessary
packages from any cyber coffee or a friend house.

Hi, to all users and possibly devellopers of Sushi, huh?, I'm desired to stop working on Sushi, huh? because now I have no need to use it, I have not fun coding it(it becomes really boring now), and I can not retrieve monetary retribution from it. Also I want to start a new proyect and this is a waste of time, sorry.
But please remember that Sushi, huh? is 100% Free Open Source Software(GPLv3), then you can take my work and continue it. Also if you have some question about how Sushi, huh? works, be free to send me a mail :)
