How to install?
===============

Sushi, huh? wasn't thanked for be installed, Sushi, huh? was thanked like as a
mobile software, it means that you download from Internet, uncompress the file,
save it in a pendrive and use anywhere, you don't loose your time in
unnecessary installations and configurations.
Also you must have root permitions for install programs under Unix/Linux.
Also, I really don't know how to install a program and there files to a system,
I'm totally newie, sorry.
